Matlab code useful for a better comprehension the .csv file with the data extraction from bagfiles through ROS. In particular, the file .csv you can extract from the bag files has converted to a .xlsx file with Microsoft Excel and it has used in the Matlab code.

Matlab code use the dataset and add to it a new column (sixth column). Each marker in the dataset corresponds to a specific part of the table (the table itself or one of the  four legs). There exist real and fictive markers.

(Check the documentation provided with the dataset)

The correspondence between each marker and the specific part of the table is the purpose of the Matlab function. Matlab function takes as input the dataset and it creates a new dataset with the correspondence (new column).
